# Research Findings — 2026-01-27 (Grok Session)

Late-night research session using Grok on X/Twitter. Two main topics: shitcoin bot improvements and Clawdbot ecosystem updates.

---

## 🧠💰 Shitcoin Bot — Execution & Architecture Improvements

### Recommended Execution Engines

| Engine | Use Case | Why |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Freqtrade** | CEX trading | Python-native, Ollama-compatible, extensive backtesting, plugin ecosystem |
| **Hummingbot** | DEX trading | Market-making focus, DEX connectors, open-source |

**Freqtrade** is the top pick for our setup — it's Python-native (matches our stack), has built-in Ollama integration for AI-driven strategies, and supports all major CEXs. Replace custom execution logic with Freqtrade as the backbone.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

- **CrewAI** or **Autogen** for orchestrating multiple AI agents (research, quant, risk, execution)
- Each agent can use different LLMs (local or API) based on task complexity
- Fits our existing dev-teams.md role architecture

### Free/Cheap APIs for 2026

| API | What It Provides | Cost |
|-----|-------------------|------|
| **DeFiLlama** | On-chain TVL, protocol data, yields | **FREE** |
| **Covalent/GoldRush** | Multi-chain indexed data | 100k free credits/month |
| **Dune Analytics** | Custom SQL queries on blockchain data | Free tier available |
| **Perception.to** | Social sentiment (replaces LunarCrush) | Free tier / cheap |

**Action**: Replace LunarCrush with **Perception.to** for sentiment analysis. LunarCrush pricing has become prohibitive.

### Local LLM Strategy

| Model | Role | Latency |
|-------|------|---------|
| **qwen3:8b** | Real-time signal processing | <2s response |
| **gpt-oss:20b** | Daily strategy review, portfolio rebalancing | ~5-10s |

This two-tier approach keeps real-time decisions fast while using heavier models for strategic thinking.

### Reference Implementation

- **chainstacklabs/web3-ai-trading-agent** (GitHub) — production-grade web3 AI trading agent
- Good architecture reference for our bot redesign

### New Trading Venues

- **Polymarket** integration as a trading venue (already running on Mac Mini)
- **Micro-trade compounding strategy**: Many small high-conviction bets compound faster than fewer large bets
- Political/geopolitical "NO" bets remain the best performers

### X/Twitter Sentiment Scanning

- **Proven profitable** — example: @Legendaryy runs a $2K wallet trading autonomously based on X sentiment
- Our existing Grok integration can power this
- Combine with Perception.to for structured sentiment data

## 🤖 Clawdbot Ecosystem Updates

### Community Growth
- **29,000+ GitHub stars** — massive community growth
- Active development, frequent releases

### Key Features (2026.1.24+)

| Feature | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Ollama auto-discovery** | Landed Jan 24, 2026. Automatically finds Ollama instances on the network — perfect for our multi-machine setup |
| **New channels** | LINE, Teams, Nostr, Slack webhook support |
| **Hybrid BM25 + vector memory search** | Better memory retrieval, combines keyword + semantic search |
| **Per-agent tool policies** | Restrict which tools each agent can use (security) |
| **Docker sandboxing** | Isolate agent execution environments |
| **Lobster plugin** | Approval gates — ideal for trading bot safety (human-in-the-loop before trades) |
| **MCP experiments** | Cross-machine context sync via Model Context Protocol |

### Recommendations

1. **Update to 2026.1.24+** — Ollama auto-discovery alone justifies the upgrade
2. **Adopt ClawdHub skills** — Community-shared skill packages
3. **Enable Lobster plugin** for trading bot — adds approval gates before real money moves
4. **Explore MCP** for syncing context between MacBook ↔ Mac Mini ↔ Windows
