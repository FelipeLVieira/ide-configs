# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## WARNING: CRITICAL: Cloud Storage

**Felipe uses MEGA, NOT Google Drive.**
- [NO] NEVER access Google Drive
- [NO] NEVER suggest Google Drive
- [OK] Use MEGA for all cloud storage needs

## WARNING: CRITICAL: iOS Work on Mac Mini ONLY

**All iOS simulator/Xcode work must happen on Mac Mini!**
- [NO] NEVER open simulators on MacBook
- [NO] NEVER run xcodebuild on MacBook
- [OK] Use SSH: `ssh felipemacmini@felipes-mac-mini.local '<command>'`
- [OK] Use nodes.run: `nodes.run(mac-mini, [...])`
- MacBook = orchestration only, Mac Mini = iOS builds

## WARNING: CRITICAL: iOS Builds - LOCAL ONLY, NO EAS CLOUD

**Build iOS apps LOCALLY with Xcode, NOT EAS Cloud!**
- [NO] NEVER use `eas build` for iOS
- [NO] NEVER use EAS cloud builds
- [OK] Use `xcodebuild` locally on Mac Mini
- [OK] Use `npx expo run:ios` for dev builds
- [OK] Archive with Xcode for App Store submission

**Why:** EAS Cloud has build quotas and costs money. Local builds are free and faster.

**Build commands (on Mac Mini):**
```bash
# Dev build
cd ~/repos/app-name
npx expo run:ios --device "iPhone 17 Pro Max"

# Production archive for App Store
xcodebuild -workspace ios/AppName.xcworkspace -scheme AppName -configuration Release -archivePath build/AppName.xcarchive archive
xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath build/AppName.xcarchive -exportPath build/AppStore -exportOptionsPlist ios/ExportOptions.plist
```

## Grok (X/Twitter AI) - USE THIS TO SAVE CREDITS!

Felipe is logged into his X account with Grok access. **Use Grok for:**
- Research tasks (market analysis, news, trends)
- Getting a second opinion on complex problems
- Quick fact-checking or information gathering
- Saving Claude API credits on routine queries

**How to use:**
1. Open browser to x.com/i/grok or use the Grok sidebar on X
2. Ask Grok your question
3. Use the response to inform your work

**When to use Grok vs Claude:**
- Grok: Research, news, market data, quick queries, second opinions
- Claude: Complex reasoning, code, file operations, tool use

This saves money AND gives you diverse perspectives!

## Mac Mini Remote Control (Full Access)
- **Screen capture**: `screencapture -x /tmp/screen.png` via nodes.run [OK]
- **Peekaboo**: Screen Recording permission granted [OK]
- **Mouse control**: `cliclick` installed, Accessibility granted [OK]
  - Click: `cliclick c:x,y`
  - Type: `cliclick t:text`
  - Move: `cliclick m:x,y`
  - Position: `cliclick p`
- **AppleScript**: `osascript` works [OK] (dialogs, app control, UI scripting)
- **Keyboard**: via cliclick [OK]
- **File system**: full read/write [OK]
- **SSH**: MacBook -> Mac Mini (passwordless) [OK]
- **SSH**: Mac Mini -> MacBook: NOT working (MacBook Remote Login disabled)
- **Code sync**: Mac Mini pushes to git, MacBook pulls
- **Felipe's remote access**: Chrome Remote Desktop (internet)

### How to check Mac Mini screen:
```bash
# Via nodes.run (from MacBook orchestrator)
nodes.run(mac-mini, ["bash", "-c", "cd /tmp && /usr/sbin/screencapture -x screen.png && echo done"])
# Then scp to MacBook and analyze
```

### How to click a dialog:
```bash
# 1. Capture screen
# 2. Analyze with image tool to find button coordinates
# 3. Click
nodes.run(mac-mini, ["cliclick", "c:500,400"])
```

## Windows MSI (via Tailscale SSH)
- **SSH**: `ssh msi` (configured in ~/.ssh/config with SOCKS proxy)
- **User**: felip
- **Tailscale IP**: 100.67.241.32
- **Note**: Both Macs use Tailscale in userspace-networking mode (SOCKS5 on localhost:1055)
- **From Mac Mini**: same `ssh msi` works

## QWEN Local LLM (Mac Mini)
- **Model**: qwen2.5-coder:7b-instruct-q5_K_M (5.4 GB)
- **Ollama**: http://localhost:11434 on Mac Mini
- **Cost**: FREE — use for all automated/cron tasks
- **Mac Mini Clawdbot config**: Primary model = QWEN, fallback = Sonnet -> Opus
- **Cron jobs on Mac Mini**: Shitcoin Brain (10min), Quant (15min), Health (30min) — all QWEN

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room -> Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door -> Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server -> 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.
